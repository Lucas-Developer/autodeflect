# The "remap" dictionary is the central configuration store of client
# data in autodeflect. This data can be manually generated, machine
# generated or some combination of the two. Deflect uses a web
# interface for this data (https://dashboard.deflect.ca - open sourced
# code coming soon!). 

# It's important that you sanitise this information extensively before
# allowing it into the clients.yml file. If you're allowing multi-line
# strings or similar into your configs, services may be disrupted.
